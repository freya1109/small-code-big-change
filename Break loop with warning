It is always hard to debug within loops. 

If there is an error message, loop will be terminated automatically; however, if there is only a warning message, the loop 
will continue with warning message reported at the very end.

In the debug process, we want to suspend the program whenever there is a warning message created.

The code "options(warn=2)" helps to make a warning message into error message. 
Afterwards, use options(warn=1) to restore the default setting.
